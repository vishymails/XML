<SCENE><TITLE>SCENE I.  Venice. A street.</TITLE>
<STAGEDIR>Enter RODERIGO and IAGO</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly</LINE>
<LINE>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse</LINE>
<LINE>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Sblood, but you will not hear me:</LINE>
<LINE>If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</LINE>
<LINE>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</LINE>
<LINE>Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,</LINE>
<LINE>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:</LINE>
<LINE>But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,</LINE>
<LINE>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance</LINE>
<LINE>Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;</LINE>
<LINE>And, in conclusion,</LINE>
<LINE>Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,</LINE>
<LINE>'I have already chose my officer.'</LINE>
<LINE>And what was he?</LINE>
<LINE>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</LINE>
<LINE>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</LINE>
<LINE>A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;</LINE>
<LINE>That never set a squadron in the field,</LINE>
<LINE>Nor the division of a battle knows</LINE>
<LINE>More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,</LINE>
<LINE>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</LINE>
<LINE>As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,</LINE>
<LINE>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:</LINE>
<LINE>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</LINE>
<LINE>At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds</LINE>
<LINE>Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd</LINE>
<LINE>By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,</LINE>
<LINE>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</LINE>
<LINE>And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,</LINE>
<LINE>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</LINE>
<LINE>And not by old gradation, where each second</LINE>
<LINE>Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,</LINE>
<LINE>Whether I in any just term am affined</LINE>
<LINE>To love the Moor.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I would not follow him then.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O, sir, content you;</LINE>
<LINE>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</LINE>
<LINE>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark</LINE>
<LINE>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,</LINE>
<LINE>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</LINE>
<LINE>Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,</LINE>
<LINE>For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:</LINE>
<LINE>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</LINE>
<LINE>Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,</LINE>
<LINE>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</LINE>
<LINE>And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,</LINE>
<LINE>Do well thrive by them and when they have lined</LINE>
<LINE>their coats</LINE>
<LINE>Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;</LINE>
<LINE>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</LINE>
<LINE>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</LINE>
<LINE>In following him, I follow but myself;</LINE>
<LINE>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</LINE>
<LINE>But seeming so, for my peculiar end:</LINE>
<LINE>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</LINE>
<LINE>The native act and figure of my heart</LINE>
<LINE>In compliment extern, 'tis not long after</LINE>
<LINE>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</LINE>
<LINE>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What a full fortune does the thicklips owe</LINE>
<LINE>If he can carry't thus!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call up her father,</LINE>
<LINE>Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,</LINE>
<LINE>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</LINE>
<LINE>And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,</LINE>
<LINE>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</LINE>
<LINE>Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,</LINE>
<LINE>As it may lose some colour.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</LINE>
<LINE>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</LINE>
<LINE>Is spied in populous cities.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!</LINE>
<LINE>Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!</LINE>
<LINE>Thieves! thieves!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>BRABANTIO appears above, at a window</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What is the reason of this terrible summons?</LINE>
<LINE>What is the matter there?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Signior, is all your family within?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Are your doors lock'd?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Why, wherefore ask you this?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on</LINE>
<LINE>your gown;</LINE>
<LINE>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</LINE>
<LINE>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</LINE>
<LINE>Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;</LINE>
<LINE>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</LINE>
<LINE>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</LINE>
<LINE>Arise, I say.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What, have you lost your wits?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Not I what are you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>My name is Roderigo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>The worser welcome:</LINE>
<LINE>I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:</LINE>
<LINE>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</LINE>
<LINE>My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,</LINE>
<LINE>Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</LINE>
<LINE>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</LINE>
<LINE>To start my quiet.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, sir, sir,--</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>But thou must needs be sure</LINE>
<LINE>My spirit and my place have in them power</LINE>
<LINE>To make this bitter to thee.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Patience, good sir.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;</LINE>
<LINE>My house is not a grange.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Most grave Brabantio,</LINE>
<LINE>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not</LINE>
<LINE>serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to</LINE>
<LINE>do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll</LINE>
<LINE>have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;</LINE>
<LINE>you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have</LINE>
<LINE>coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>What profane wretch art thou?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter</LINE>
<LINE>and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Thou art a villain.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>You are--a senator.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,</LINE>
<LINE>If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,</LINE>
<LINE>As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,</LINE>
<LINE>At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,</LINE>
<LINE>Transported, with no worse nor better guard</LINE>
<LINE>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</LINE>
<LINE>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--</LINE>
<LINE>If this be known to you and your allowance,</LINE>
<LINE>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;</LINE>
<LINE>But if you know not this, my manners tell me</LINE>
<LINE>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</LINE>
<LINE>That, from the sense of all civility,</LINE>
<LINE>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:</LINE>
<LINE>Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,</LINE>
<LINE>I say again, hath made a gross revolt;</LINE>
<LINE>Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes</LINE>
<LINE>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</LINE>
<LINE>Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:</LINE>
<LINE>If she be in her chamber or your house,</LINE>
<LINE>Let loose on me the justice of the state</LINE>
<LINE>For thus deluding you.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Strike on the tinder, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>Give me a taper! call up all my people!</LINE>
<LINE>This accident is not unlike my dream:</LINE>
<LINE>Belief of it oppresses me already.</LINE>
<LINE>Light, I say! light!</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exit above</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>IAGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Farewell; for I must leave you:</LINE>
<LINE>It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,</LINE>
<LINE>To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--</LINE>
<LINE>Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,</LINE>
<LINE>However this may gall him with some cheque,</LINE>
<LINE>Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd</LINE>
<LINE>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</LINE>
<LINE>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</LINE>
<LINE>Another of his fathom they have none,</LINE>
<LINE>To lead their business: in which regard,</LINE>
<LINE>Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.</LINE>
<LINE>Yet, for necessity of present life,</LINE>
<LINE>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</LINE>
<LINE>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</LINE>
<LINE>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;</LINE>
<LINE>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<STAGEDIR>Exit</STAGEDIR>
<STAGEDIR>Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches</STAGEDIR>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>It is too true an evil: gone she is;</LINE>
<LINE>And what's to come of my despised time</LINE>
<LINE>Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!</LINE>
<LINE>With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!</LINE>
<LINE>How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me</LINE>
<LINE>Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:</LINE>
<LINE>Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Truly, I think they are.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!</LINE>
<LINE>Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds</LINE>
<LINE>By what you see them act. Is there not charms</LINE>
<LINE>By which the property of youth and maidhood</LINE>
<LINE>May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,</LINE>
<LINE>Of some such thing?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Yes, sir, I have indeed.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!</LINE>
<LINE>Some one way, some another. Do you know</LINE>
<LINE>Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>RODERIGO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>I think I can discover him, if you please,</LINE>
<LINE>To get good guard and go along with me.</LINE>
</SPEECH>

<SPEECH>
<SPEAKER>BRABANTIO</SPEAKER>
<LINE>Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;</LINE>
<LINE>I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!</LINE>
<LINE>And raise some special officers of night.</LINE>
<LINE>On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.</LINE>
</SPEECH>


<STAGEDIR>Exeunt</STAGEDIR>
